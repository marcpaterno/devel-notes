# PandAna3 development on laptop

I'm still trying to figure out if I want to use an IDE for Python work.
The candidates are PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.
I also work directly at the command line.


## General

The work is in `$HOME/repos/pandana3`.
I use a conda environment `pandana-base`.

    cd ~/repos/pandana3
    source ~/bin/setup-cosmosis
    conda activate pandana-base

## Command line



## Visual Studio Code



## PyCharm

TBD.
